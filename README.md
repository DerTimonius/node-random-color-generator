If the program is run without any additional input, it will print a certain pattern in the color written inside the box.

But the user can also change the input by providing a single value for the hue - then a random color will be chosen according to that hue.

The user may also provide an additional value for the luminosity.

And if the user isn't sure about the options, `node index.js ask` can be run which asks questions about the color and the luminosity.
