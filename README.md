# Node Random Color Generator

If the program is run without any additional input, it will print a certain pattern in the color written inside the box.

But the user can also change the input by providing a single value for the hue - then a random color will be chosen according to that hue.

The user may also provide an additional value for the luminosity.

If the user wants the box may also be resized.

And if the user isn't sure about the options, `node index.js ask` can be run which asks questions about the color and the luminosity.
